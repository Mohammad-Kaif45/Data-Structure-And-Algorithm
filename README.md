# Data-Structure-And-Algorithm

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository!   
This repo contains a collection of coding problems, solutions, and notes that I‚Äôm solving and practicing to strengthen my DSA skills. 

# DSA Practice ‚Äì Arrays
 
This repository contains Java solutions to various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems based on **Arrays**. Each problem is implemented with clean code, appropriate logic, and comments to help understand the solution clearly.
